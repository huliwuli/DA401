Run the 401. rmd first for factors study

Run the 401 part two.rmd for machine learning

If you encounter some issues related to the package, you may need to download manually from "install" in R studio.
You can try to run the package codes to check your environment issue.

At the end of 401.rmd file, I exported the "predictions dataset" , which will be used in 401 part two.rmd file.
You may need to uncomment for this part if you want to generate new file for predictions dataset.

I do not take any responsibility for losing money.
